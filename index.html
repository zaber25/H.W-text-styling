    <p id ="text1">Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family
        Canidae. They have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; and a long,
        bushy tail ("brush")</p>
    <p id="text2">Foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family Canidae such as wolves and
        jackals, while they may be larger than some within the family, such as raccoon dogs. In the largest species, the
        red fox, males weigh between 4.1 and 8.7 kg (9.0 and 19.2 lb),[7] while the smallest species, the fennec fox,
        weighs just 0.7 to 1.6 kg (1+1⁄2 to 3+1⁄2 lb).[8]</p>
    <p id=>In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten
        years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but
        some (such as Arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.</p>
